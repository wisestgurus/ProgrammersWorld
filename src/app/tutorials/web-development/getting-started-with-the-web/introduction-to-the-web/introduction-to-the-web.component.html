        <p>In a library consisting of millions of books, each book has its own number of pages. Depending on the book,
            a page might have images in it, some might include icons in it as well, and in general the text of every
            page in a book is styled nicely.

        Continuing from the library example above. Remember the library consist of different books (which is equivalent
        to the web consisting of different websites), but how can people get good delivery after buying those books.
        Fortunately, the library has a delivery person which delivers the books to those who buy it.

                successfully</b>.
