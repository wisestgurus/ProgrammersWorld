        <p>An <b>information system</b> made up of different websites linked together is referred to as <b>the web</b>.
            (An information system in a layman term is anything designed to collect, process, store, and distribute
            information).</p>

        <div pwAlert='info'>A website links two or more webpages together, but the web
            links two or more websites together. Please try and understand the difference.</div>


        <h5 class="heading">brief analogy of the web</h5>
        <p>In a library consisting of millions of books, each book has its own number of pages and every book is
            recognized by its unique name. Depending on the book and the author, a book can include images in some its
            pages, some only have text in it, some can be well descriptive with lots of illustrations, some
            might include icons in it and in general the text of every page in a book is styled nicely based on the
            taste of the author.

            Continuing from the library example above. People generally visit the library to buy books and some prefer
            to order. Fortunately enough, the library has a delivery man responsible for delivering various books
            successfully, to whomsover orders.
        </p>

    <h6 class="font-weight-bolder">Now read carefully;</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The delivery man connects the library with billions of buyers (i.e. he serves as an interemediary).
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>The internet</b> is similar to a <b>delivery man</b>.
            The only difference being that the internet is an <b>intermediary network with much broader connectivity</b>
            (i.e. can connect someone from Nigeria, to someone in UK, with another person in US, with another person in
            Nigeria again (and so on and so forth) bonding them all together in its own network for sharing of data or
            resources).
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>The delivery person</b> is equivalent to the <b>internet</b>, because he/she <b>connects</b> two or more
            bodies or <b>networks together</b> (e.g. the library with upto 1 million buyers together) and <b>delivers
                the books successfully</b>.
